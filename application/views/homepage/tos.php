DATA PRIVACY AND SECURITY</strong><br />4.1 In providing You the Service We shall maintain appropriate administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the security, confidentiality and integrity of Your data.

Synergy Software shall have a royalty-free, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to incorporate into the Service or otherwise use any suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or other feedback We receive from You. Synergy Software&reg;, and Synergy Software&rsquo;s other product and service names, and logos used or displayed on the Service are registered or unregistered trademarks of Synergy Software (collectively, &ldquo;Marks&rdquo;), and You may only use such Marks to identify yourself as a customer and user of the Service; provided You do not attempt, now or in the future, to claim any rights in the Marks, degrade the distinctiveness of the Marks, or use the Marks to disparage or misrepresent Synergy Software, its services or products.</p>
<p><strong>6. THIRD PARTY SERVICES</strong><br />6.1 External Sites. The Service may contain links to, or otherwise may allow You to connect to and use certain marketplaces, third party products, services or software under separate terms and conditions (collectively, &ldquo;Other Services&rdquo;) in conjunction with Our Service. If You decide to access and use such Other Services, be advised that Your use is governed solely by the terms and conditions of such Other Services, and We do not endorse, are not responsible for, and make no representations as to such Other Services, their content or the manner in which they handle Your data. Synergy Software is not liable for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with Your access or use of any such Other Services, or Your reliance on the privacy practices or other policies of such Other Services.</p>
<p>6.2 Integration. The Service may contain features that enable various Other Services (such as social media services like Facebook and Twitter) to be directly integrated into your Synergy Software experience. To take advantage of these features, You will be required to register for or log into such Other Services on their respective websites. By enabling third party services within the Service, You are allowing Synergy Software to pass Your log-in information to these Other Services for this purpose.</p>
<p>6.3 Third-Party Feeds/API&rsquo;s. Synergy Software uses third-party feeds and API&rsquo;s to send and receive information on Your behalf. It is not uncommon for API&rsquo;s to experience slowdowns and cause delays in processing Your changes. Under no circumstances will Synergy Software be held responsible for any issues or delays caused by third-party feeds or API&rsquo;s.</p>
<p><strong>7. BILLING, PLAN MODIFICATIONS AND PAYMENTS</strong><br />7.1 Billing and Payments. The Service is made available on a pay-as-you-go basis and is charged at the start of Your elected subscription term (generally monthly or annually). If You do not provide Your credit card or other payment information to Synergy Software before the expiration of any free trial period, Your account will be suspended until payment information and charge authorization are provided. You will be promptly billed and, if applicable, any trial period will terminate. Thereafter, Your subscription will renew automatically based on Your plan&rsquo;s renewal cycle. The Service provides an interface for the account owner to change credit card information (e.g., upon card renewal). The account owner will receive a receipt upon each payment received, or they may obtain a receipt from within the application to be able to track the status of Your subscription.</p>
<p>7.2 Modifying Your Subscription. If You choose to upgrade Your plan during Your elected subscription period, any incremental cost will be prorated over the remaining term of the subscription period and charged to Your account. Subsequently, You will be charged the adjusted rate on Your next billing cycle. If You are on a monthly billing cycle, You will not see a prorated charge or credit in the current month, but Your new billing rate will be reflected on Your next monthly bill. Regardless of Your billing cycle, <strong>there are no refunds or credits for partial months of Service, plan downgrades, or refunds for unused time.</strong> No exceptions will be made. Downgrading Your plan level may cause the loss of content, features, or capacity of Your account and Synergy Software does not accept any liability for such loss. If your monthly usage exceeds your selected plan allowance, or significantly exceeds the average monthly usage (as determined solely by Synergy Software), we reserve the right to immediately upgrade, disable or throttle your account.</p>
<p>7.3 Overdue Charges. If You fail to pay your subscription fee on time, or if Your credit card payment information is entered in error or does not go through for processing and You do not update payment information upon Our request, your entire subscription may be suspended or cancelled.</p>
<p>7.4 Billing Privacy. Synergy Software uses a third-party intermediary to manage credit card processing and this intermediary is not permitted to store, retain, or use Your billing information except to process Your credit card information for Synergy Software. For more information about Our billing practices and Your personal information please visit Our Privacy Policy: <a href="https://legendrepricing.com/home/privacy">https://legendrepricing.com/home/privacy</a>.</p>
<p>7.5 Taxes. Unless otherwise stated, Our charges do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments, including value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes assessable by any local, state, provincial or foreign jurisdiction (collectively &ldquo;Taxes&rdquo;). You are responsible for paying Taxes except those assessable against Synergy Software based on its income. We will invoice You for such Taxes if we believe we have a legal obligation to do so.</p>
<p>7.6 Price Changes. Synergy Software reserves the right to change prices without prior notification as long as current accounts remain at the rates that were active at the time of subscription. Changes to the rates affecting existing accounts will be made only after timely notification has been sent. Such notifications will be posted on the Synergy Software Site (legendrepricing.com) and sent via email to the email address each customer has provided during registration.</p>
<p><strong>8. CANCELLATION AND TERMINATION</strong><br />8.1 You are responsible for canceling Your account, and can cancel Your account by clicking on the account link located in the menu at the top of the screen. There are no other means of canceling Your account. Once You cancel Your account You will lose access to all of Your content, and We preserve the right to delete all such content in the normal course of operation. This content cannot be recovered once Your account is cancelled. If You cancel the Service before the end of Your current paid-up subscription period, Your cancellation will take effect immediately and You will not be charged again.</p>
<p>8.2 Synergy Software reserves the right to (i) modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any part thereof) and (ii) refuse any/all current and future use of the Service, suspend or terminate your account or any part thereof (or Your use of the Service), and remove and discard any of Your content within the Service if We believe that You have violated these Terms. Synergy Software will use all reasonable efforts to contact You directly via email to warn You prior to suspension or termination of Your account. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive, or illegal activity may be grounds for immediate termination of Your use of Service, and may be referred to law enforcement authorities. Synergy Software shall not be liable to You or any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuation of the Service.</p>
<p><strong>9. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</strong><br />YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.

THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF THIS SECTION 10.2 IS TO ALLOCATE THE RISKS UNDER THESE TERMS BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND LIMIT THEIR POTENTIAL LIABILITY GIVEN THE FEES CHARGED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER IF Synergy Software WERE TO ASSUME ANY FURTHER LIABILITY OTHER THAN AS SET FORTH HEREIN.

<p><strong>12. ASSIGNMENT; ENTIRE AGREEMENT; REVISIONS</strong><br />Synergy Software may assign or transfer these Terms, in whole or in part, without restriction, provided the assignee agree to be fully bound by these Terms.

We may amend these Terms from time to time, in which case the new Terms will supersede prior versions.</p>
<p><strong>13. SEVERABILITY</strong><br />The failure of Synergy Software to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties&rsquo; intentions as reflected in the provision, and to construe such provision to the maximum extent permitted by law so as to render that provision valid and enforceable, and the other provisions of the Terms remain in full force and effect. YOU AND Synergy Software AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SITE OR SERVICES MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES, OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.</p>
